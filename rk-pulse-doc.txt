If you prefer to run the client from a Windows PC, you can try out the C# .NET Console Application provided.
I have compiled it under Visual Studio 2010 Professional as well as Visual Studio Commumity 2015 using 
Target framework 3.5. or 4.5. 

For the test set up, I created a simple pulse generator using a ChipKit MAX32 Microcontroller board 
using a mixture of C and assembly to exploit the high speed I/O toggling capability of the Microchip 
PIC32MX795F512H (80MHz). This allowed me to generate pulses as short as 60 nanoSeconds.
This lets us almost reach the limits of the system. 

The table below shows the results of capturing pulse trains using a variety of values.

Pulse Duration       Hex Value

(-ve) 3960 nS        0000018C
(+ve) 1950 nS        000000C5 

(-ve) 465 nS         0000002E
(+ve) 335 nS         0000001E 

(-ve) 61.5 nS        00000006
(+ve) 61.5 nS        00000003
